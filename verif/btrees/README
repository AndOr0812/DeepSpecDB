This folder contains the VST proof of a B+Trees with Cursors library

A technical report can be found in the papers/aurele/ directory, or at https://github.com/Aurele-Barriere/vst_btrees .

You can compile the proofs using `make`.
Typing `make quick` compiles them using the quick option of coqc, which does not check the proofs but quickly creates a .vio file with every definition.

The proofs compile using the last version of VST, as of June 8, 2018 (commit e679c09e351369dbfefda59c05e3b1aac9ecbae8), and Coq 8.8.

The C library for B+Trees with cursors is made up of the two files
relation_mem.c and relation.h.
Some differences can be expected with the library found in the src/ directory, for ease of verification.

The corresponding Clight file (generated with CompCert's clightgen) is located in
relation_mem.v

The file btrees.v describes the functional model of the library, its operations (insertion, moving the cursors...) and related theorems.

The file btrees_sep.v describes the memory representation predicates and related theorems.

The file btrees_spec.v gathers every specification of the library.

Finally, the files verif_*.v contain the VST body proofs for correctness.
