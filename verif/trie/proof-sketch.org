* Trie
** TODO [next_cursor] and [first_cursor]
- best scenario: these functions work for partial cursor
- or at least provide a version for partial cursor(higher priority)
** TODO [get]
- use cursor funcitons, since a cursor might not point to some existing keys
** TODO [key_rel] using [flatten] and [get]
- Trying to reduce the difficulty entirely to flatten_invariant
** TODO [flatten_invariant]
- flatten functions have been designed, this should be the most difficult part for the proof
